init rather than set_target on Controllers on load (#3580)

The load path for ControllerModulationSources would call
set_target on the modulator. This meant the modulators
after a load would need to snap up to target. Fine. ALmost
noone would ever notice that. *Except* the VST3 getParamNormalized
asks for output, not target, of the controller, which is correct.

But if you have a DAW which asks for the paramNormalized then sets
that back on at load time, like Ardour can in teh VST3, that means your
saved value get overridden

So change ->set_target to ->init which has the sole difference
of snapping the output to targe ton load, which is correct

Closes #3561
